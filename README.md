# FHA-based-Dilithium

We currently label the proposed hash function as IOSHA in the code, but the internal logic is actually based on FHA. We kept the IOSHA name for now to avoid having to rename all referenced functions throughout the codebase. As soon as possible, I will rename IOSHA to FHA across the project and push the updated changes to Git.
